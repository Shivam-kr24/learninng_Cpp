Call by Value in C++
Call by value is a method in C++ to pass the values to the function arguments. In case of call by value the copies of actual parameters are sent to the formal parameter, which means that if we change the values inside the function that will not affect the actual values. 

Call by Pointer in C++
A call by the pointer is a method in C++ to pass the values to the function arguments. In the case of call by pointer, the address of actual parameters is sent to the formal parameter, which means that if we change the values inside the function that will affect the actual values.

Call by Reference in C++
Call by reference is a method in C++ to pass the values to the function arguments. In the case of call by reference, the reference of actual parameters is sent to the formal parameter, which means that if we change the values inside the function that will affect the actual values.
