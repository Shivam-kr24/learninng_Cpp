C++ Control Structures, If Else and Switch-Case Statement | C
In this series of our C++ tutorials, we will visualize the control structure, if-else, and switch statements in the C++ language in this lecture. In our last lesson, we discussed the constant, manipulators and operator precedence in C++.


Control Structures in C++
The work of control structures is to give flow and logic to a program. There are three types of basic control structures in C++.

1.Sequence Structure
Sequence structure refers to the sequence in which program execute instructions one after another

2.Selection Structure
Selection structure refers to the execution of instruction according to the selected condition, which can be either true or false. There are two ways to implement selection structures, by “if-else statements” or by “switch case statements”.

3. Loop Structure
Loop structure refers to the execution of an instruction in a loop until the condition gets false.


Switch Case Statements in C++
In switch-case statements, the value of the variable is tested with all the cases.

If Else Statements in C++
As we have discussed the concepts of the different control structure, If else statements are used to implement a selection structure.
