33.Dynamic Initialization of Objects Using Constructors
Dynamic Initialization of Objects Using Constructors
The dynamic initialization of the object means that the object is initialized at the runtime.  Dynamic initialization of the object using a constructor is beneficial when the data is of different formats.

As shown in Code Snippet 1,......>

1st we created a “BankDeposit” class which consists of private data members “principal”, “years”, “interestRate”, and “returnValue”.
2nd default constructor of the “BankDeposit” class is declared.
3rd parameterized constructor of the “BankDeposit” class is declared which takes three parameters “p”, “y”, and “r”. The main thing to note here is that the parameter “r” is of a float data type.
4th parameterized constructor of the “BankDeposit” class is declared which takes three parameters “p”, “y”, and “r”. The main thing to note here is that the parameter “r” is of an integer data type.
5th function “show” is declared.


Code Snippet 2: Definition of Constructors and Function

As shown in Code snippet 2,

1st the constructor “BankDeposit” is defined in which the value of the parameter “p” is assigned to the data member “principal”; the value of the parameter “y” is assigned to the data member “year”; the value of the parameter “r” is assigned to the data member “interestRate”. At the end “for” loop is defined which will run till the length of the variable “y” and add “1” in the “interestRate”; then multiply the value with the “returnValue”. The main thing to note here is that in this constructor the data type of the parameter “r” is float.
2nd another constructor “BankDeposit” is defined in which the value of the parameter “p” is assigned to the data member “principal”; the value of the parameter “y” is assigned to the data member “year”; the value of the parameter “r” is converted to “float” and divided by “100” then assigned to the data member “interestRate”. At the end “for” loop is defined which will run till the length of the variable “y” and add “1” in the “interestRate”; then multiply the value with the “returnValue”. The main thing to note here is that in this constructor the data type of the parameter “r” is float.
3rd the function “show” is defined which will print the values of the data members “principal”, “year”, and “returnValue”.


Code Snippet 3: Main Program

As shown in a code snippet 3,

1st the object “bd1”, “bd2”, and “bd3” of the data type “BankDeposit” are created.
2nd the integer variables “p” and “y” are declared; the float variable “r” is declared, and the integer variable “R” is declared.
3rd the values for the variables “p”, “y”, and”r” are taken from the user on the runtime.
4th parameterized constructor “BankDeposit” is called with the object “bd1” and the variables “p”, “y”, and “r” are passed. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with float parameters “r”.
5th function “show” is called which will print the values of data members
6th the values for the variables “p”, “y”, and ”R” are taken from the user on the runtime.
7th parameterized constructor “BankDeposit” is called with the object “bd2” and the variables “p”, “y”, and “R” are passed. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with integer parameters “R”.
8th function “show” is called which will print the values of data members.
