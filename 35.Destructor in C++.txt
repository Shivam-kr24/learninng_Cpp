35.Destructor in C++

Destructor in C++
A destructor is a type of function which is called when the object is destroyed. Destructor never takes an argument nor does it return any value. 

Code Snippet 1: Destructor Example Program

As shown in Code Snippet 1,

1st global variable “count” is initialized.
2nd we created a “num” class.
3rd default constructor of the “num” class is defined which has no parameters and does increment in the variable “count” and prints its value. The main thing to note here is that every time the new object will be created this constructor will run.
4th destructor of the “num” class is defined. The destructor prints the value of the variable “count” and decrement in the value of “count”. The main thing to note here is that every time the object has been destroyed this destructor will run.

Code Snippet 2: Main Program

As shown in Code Snippet 2,

1st object “n1” is created of the “num” data type. The main thing to note here is that when the object “n1” is created the constructor will run.
2nd inside the block two objects “n2” and “n3” are created of the “num” data type. The main things to note here are that when the objects “n2” and “n3” are created the constructor will run for both objects and when the block ends the destructor will run for both objects “n2” and “n3”.
3rd when the program ends the destructor for the object “n1” will run.
