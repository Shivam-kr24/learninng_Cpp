Object-Oriented programming Recap
Stroustrup initially named C++ language as C with classes because C++ language was almost the same as C language but they added a new concept of classes in it.
Classes are the extension of structures in C language.
Structures had limitations such as; members are public and no methods.
Classes have some additional futures than structures such as; classes that can have methods and properties.
Classes have a feature to make class members as public and private.


Nesting of Member Functions
If one member function is called inside the other member function of the same class it is called nesting of a member function.
