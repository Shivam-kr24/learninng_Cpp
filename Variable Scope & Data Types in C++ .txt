Variable Scope & Data Types in C++ in Hindi | C++ Tutorials for Beginners #4
In this series of C++ tutorials, we will visualize the variable scope and data types in the C++ language in this lecture. In our last lesson, we discussed the variable's role and comments. In this C++ tutorial, we are going to cover two important concepts of C++:

Variable Scope
Data Types
Before explaining the concept of variable scope, I would like to clarify about variables a little more. Variable can be defined as a container to hold data. Variables are of different types, for example:

Int-> Int is used to store integer data e.g (-1, 2, 5,-9, 3, 100).
Float-> Float is used to store decimal numbers e.g (0.5, 1.05, 3.5, 10.5)
Char-> Char is used to store a single character e.g. ('a', 'b',' c', 'd')
Boolean-> Boolean is used to store "true" or "false."
Double-> Double is also used to store decimal numbers but has more precision than float, e.g. (10.5895758440339...)
Here is an example to understand variables: int sum = 34; means that sum is an integer variable that holds value '34' in memory.

Syntax for Declaring Variables in C++

Data_type Variable_name = Value;
Ex: int a=4; char letter = ‘p’;
Ex: int a=4, b=6;
Variable Scope
The scope of a variable is the region in the program where the existence of that variable is valid. For example, consider this analogy - if one person travels to another country illegally, we will not consider that country as its scope because he doesn't have the necessary documents to stay in that country.

Base on scope, variables can be classified into two types:

Local variables
Global variables
Local variables:
Local variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be assessed only from there. 

Global variables:
Global variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.

Data Types
Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold; for example, an integer variable can hold integer data, a character can hold character data, etc.

Data types in C++ are categorized into three groups:

Built-in
User-defined
Derived
1. Built-in Data Types in C++:
Int
Float
Char
Double
Boolean
2. User-Defined Data Types in C++:
Struct
Union
Enum


3. Derived Data Types in C++:
Array
Pointer
Function
