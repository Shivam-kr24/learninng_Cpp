Break Statements
We had already discussed a little bit about break statements in switch statements. Today we will see the working of break statements in loops. Break statements in loops are used to terminate the loop. 
this is how the break statement program will be executed:

Initialize integer variable “i” with value “0”
Check the condition if the value of the variable "i” is smaller than “40”
If the condition is true go into the loop body
Execute “cout” function
Check the condition if the value of the variable "i” is equal to “2”, if it is equal terminate the loop and get out of loop body
Update the value of “i” by one
Keep repeating these steps until the loop condition gets false, or the “if” condition inside the loop body gets true.

Continue Statements 
Continue statements are somewhat similar to break statements. The main difference is that the break statement entirely terminates the loop, but the continue statement only terminates the current iteration. 
this is how the continue statement program will be executed:

Initialize integer variable “i” with value “0”
Check the condition if the value of the variable "i” is smaller than “40”
If the condition is true go into the loop body
Check the condition if the value of the variable "i” is equal to “2", if it is equal terminate the loop for the current iteration and go to the next iteration
Execute “cout” function
Update the value of “i” by one
Keep repeating these steps until the loop condition gets false.
